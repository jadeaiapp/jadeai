        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of the JadeAI applications, website, and services (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”).
          By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and by our
          <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>The Service is intended solely for individuals who are at least <strong>18 years old</strong>. By using JadeAI, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Service Overview</h2>
        <p>JadeAI is a content-assistance platform that allows users to generate text and other outputs using the Google Gemini API. We do not operate our own foundational AI models; we provide an interface and project-specific tooling on top of Gemini.</p>
        <h3>Core features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Prompt-based content generation across multiple templates and languages.</li>
          <li>Credit-based usage system with free and premium plans.</li>
          <li>Community sharing (optional) and content management tools.</li>
          <li>Device security checks and analytics to prevent misuse.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          JadeAI acts as a facilitator of Google Gemini outputs. We do not manually edit or pre-moderate generated content. You are responsible for reviewing and evaluating the results before use.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Accounts & Eligibility</h2>

          <li>You may not create an account if you are under 18 or if your access has been previously suspended or terminated.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including content generated via your prompts.</li>
          <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, applicable law, or fair-use and security policies.</li>
